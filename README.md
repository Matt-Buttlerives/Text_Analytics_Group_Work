Text Analytics Assignment)

For insights, it's not enough to just say two brands  have higher values of lift so they are more associated, do external research:
If Toyota is more associated with Lexus than Ford, mention Toyota and Lexus are sister brands, and Lexus is more luxurious, Toyota is less luxurious, that's why they might be more associated. 


Part E:  First, define what an aspirational brand means, then do analysis.


## Assignment Flow
